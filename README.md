## Hi

I'm Matthieu CHARETTE, I'm 16, and I'm French.

I've been programming since I was 11. I began writing in Python. And years after years I've been learning many other languages like C, HTML, JavaScript, Golang, Dart...

Recently, I discovered Flutter and I can no longer program without it. It's the best tool I've ever known.

I'm currently working on [libfprint](https://github.com/freedesktop/libfprint) to add support for Goodix devices.
